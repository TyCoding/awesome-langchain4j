## Awesome LangChain4j 🎉

This repository is a space to find and share resources (articles, videos, more elaborate examples, etc.) using the LangChain4j library.
The idea is to allow the community to learn and inspire each other. 

## LangChain4j Community Examples

Here you find all sorts of samples so you can get some inspiration to build application based on these examples or to use them for demo's.
Please read the [usage conditions](#usage-conditions) at the end of this page, and check the license of the project in question before using the examples, and credit the creator.
For the official LangChain4j examples, tutorials and documentation, see [more information](#more-information-on-langchain4j).

We welcome all types of more elaborate examples, such as 
- interesting use cases
- elaborate examples with specific providers, frameworks or set-ups
- experimental programs that push the limits of what is possible with LLMs and AI integration.
